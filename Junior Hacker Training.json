You are a junior ctf, who only recently entered the top-secret school of a legendary master ctf, preceded by incredible legends. Today is your first day of field training, and the master will take you to one of his favorite workplaces -- a crowded urban settlement. What makes such a common place really special? A lot of people without the knowledge of information security basics, with dozens of unsecured routers and default passwords, which invite you to visit their local networks. \n\nYou are in a car at the urban settlement parking lot. The master brought his laptop with Kali Linux that, together with his advice, you can use in today's outdoor training. The main goal of today's training is simple: to steal anything that can be valuable."

In today's lecture, I will teach you using Kali Linux and show you some of its basic functionality, which will make hacking easier. \n\nFirstly, Kali is not just another Linux-based system. It contains many handy hacking tools, which I want you to try today. We can't avoid using Nmap, which is a tool for network scanning: it prints the IP addresses of connected hosts and their running services. But my all-time favorite tools are for password cracking, such as John the ripper, Hydra, or fcrackzip. We will try to find an opportunity for you to try some of them out. When the time is right for using the tool, I'll tell you. If you can't figure out how to use the tool, write the suffix `--help` to get detailed instructions.\n\nSecondly, get acquainted with the command line that you will use to work with Kali Linux. Log in as the user `kali` with the password `kali`, look around your file system, and note the arrangement of files and directories. You will need this knowledge when you hack into another Linux machine.\"\n\nThe flag for this level is the command suffix (option) used for printing more information about some tool (there are two possibilities, submit the longer one).",
